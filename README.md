Aphrodite is a custom backend aimed to work at **almost** all Fortnite versions. It is engineered to provide superior stability, incorporate production-grade features, and deliver exceptional performance. ðŸ”¥

It is currently not ready for production as most things aren't implemented yet. However, it is being worked on and will be ready soon.
